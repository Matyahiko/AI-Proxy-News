# AI Proxy News Prototype

This repository contains a minimal prototype for a transparent, C2PA‑signed, AI‑assisted news workflow. The goal is to record a short interview, transcribe it with Whisper, generate a summary and follow‑up questions with GPT‑4o, sign the resulting article with C2PA, and publish it via GitHub Pages.

See `docs/design.md` for the high‑level design.
